# customer-churn
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a fully connected Neural Network. The dataset contains information about customers of a company, and the goal is to determine whether a customer will exit based on a set of measured features. The project involves data cleaning, model development, and performance evaluation to provide actionable insights for the company.

## Project Objectives
**1.  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

*  Analyze and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
*  Standardize features to ensure compatibility with the neural network model.
  
**2.  Model Development**

*  Construct and train a fully connected Neural Network for binary classification.
*  Training optimizes the weights of the network using backpropagation to minimize the loss function.

**3.  Performance Evaluation**

*  Calculate performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
*  Analyze results to understand model performance and identify areas for improvement.
